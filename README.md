# Random Forest for Avalanche Prediction
A wide variety of conditions directly affect the formation of different avalanche conditions such as wet, slab, and loose powder avalanches. Similar to weather forecasts, avalanche forecasts are issued daily during the winter months by several avalanche centers located in mountainous states. Avalanche forecasts are generated by analyzing weather patterns and field reports conducted by snow science experts. These field reports involve digging deep snow pits , determining the state of the snowpack, and exposing the existence of weak layers. There are a limited number of people who are qualified to submit these field observations as the snow science field is still fairly new and is quite a labor-intensive task. Many areas lack the presence of these experts to make observation, so there is an opportunity to implement machine learning methods for forecasting.
I developed a codebase that implements a random forest classification algorithm from scratch.
The random forest is then used to predict avalanche problems from weather data.
